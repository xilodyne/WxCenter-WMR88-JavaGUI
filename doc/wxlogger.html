  <!--============== Description ==============-->

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    This program is intended for logging the data transmitted by an Oregon
    Scientific Professional Weather Station (model WMR180). The data is sent
    over a USB link to a computer (desktop or embedded). The name
    <var>WxLogger</var> derives from the common abbreviation WX for
    &quot;weather conditions&quot;.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oregon Scientific supply the <var>Virtual Weather Station</var> program.
    Several other programs are also available such as <a
    href="http://sandaysoft.com/products/cumulus/" target="_blank">Cumulus</a>
    and <a href="http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Weather Station
    Data Logger</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So why create yet another weather station program? I wished to use Java so
    that <var>WxLogger</var> could run on a large variety of systems. I
    needed only simple data logging, without more advanced features such as
    graphical display or uploading data to a remote site. I also wanted to
    create an open-source program that could be readily customised by others.
  </p>

  <p>
    The weather station USB interface is treated as a HID (Human Interface
    Device). <var>WxLogger</var> relies on JNI (Java Native Interface) code
    provided by the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/"
    target="_blank">JavaHIDAPI</a> project.
  </p>

  <p>
    <var>WxLogger</var> has been run on Linux (ARM, 32-bit) and MS Windows
    (XP/7, 32/64-bit), but should run on a number of other systems (Linux Intel
    32/64-bit, MacOS Intel 32/64-bit). I am currently running
    <var>WxLogger</var> on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"
    target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Options for running the code include <a
    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/"
    target="_blank">Oracle Java</a> and <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/"
    target="_blank">OpenJDK</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code is based on the discoveries by others of the weather station
    protocol. See the <a href="wmr180.html">interface specification</a> for the
    details. Although that work mostly concerns the WMR100, it appears to be
    relevant to the WMR180 (and probably also the WMR88). <var>WxLogger</var>
    will probably therefore work for all of these weather stations, though not
    the WMR200.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program is designed only for logging - not real-time display or data
    upload. The author has created <a href="wxdisplay.html">WxDisplay</a> and <a
    href="wxjsp.html">WxJSP</a> to display historical data using an applet.
    Command-line scripts also allow data to be extracted in various ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program tries to cope with some unusual situations that can arise. It is
    possible, for example, to receive two messages for the same hour if the
    radio clock corrects the time. On changing to or from daylight saving time,
    the clock will go forward or back. This results in a missing hour of data or
    a double hour of data respectively. The program logs the cumulative rainfall
    each day. Since this relies on the cumulative rainfall since the weather
    station rainfall memory was cleared, it is necessary to handle a clear while
    the program is running.
  </p>

  <p>
    The outdoor temperature/humidity sensor is normally the main one (channel
    1). However, this data can instead be logged from an additional outdoor
    sensor (channel 2, etc.).
  </p>

  <!--============== Customisation ==============-->

  <h2>Customisation</h2>

  <p>
    If you can live with the program defaults, you just need a JVM (Java Virtual
    Machine). If you wish to change the defaults or to alter the code, you also
    need a JDK (Java Development Kit).
  </p>

  <p>
    Customisation is possible by changing the following constants in the code
    ("customisation" section):
  </p>

  <dl>

    <dt><strong>ARCHIVE_PATH</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      directory path for archive files (default '/tmp', must not be '.', or end
      with '/' or '\'); if empty, no archiving takes place (i.e. log files
      remain in their original place)
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>BACKUP_LOG</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      when archiving, preserve the current day's log as 'LAST_DAY.DAT' (default
      true, i.e. do backup); the last day's log file will be replaced if it
      exists
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>DEGREE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      degree symbol (default Unicode degree); this may need to be set to empty
      if the console does not support Unicode
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LOG_DEFAULT</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      default flags for log output as logical OR of individual log flags
      (default hourly data, for 0 nothing, 1 USB data, 2 frame data, 4 sensor
      data, 8 hourly data)
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LOG_FILE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      name of a log file to use, or empty to mean output to the console (default
      empty)
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>LOG_INTERVAL</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      the number of minutes between log entries (default 15, i.e. 00/15/30/45
      minutes past the hour); the value must be a submultiple of 60 (e.g. 10,
      15, 20, 30)
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>OUTDOOR_SENSOR</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      outdoor temperature sensor to log (default 1)
    </dd>

  </dl>

  <p>
    Error messages and the following hourly summaries can appear in the log
    output. Hourly figures are averages for the past hour, except for rainfall
    which is cumulative. Indoor or outdoor sensor data is followed by '?' if
    there is missing data for the corresponding sensor. Outdoor sensor data is
    followed by '!' if the corresponding sensor battery is low.
  </p>

  <pre>
    HH:MM  time
    NN.N   wind speed
    NNN    wind direction
    NN.N   outdoor temperature
    NN     outdoor humidity
    NNNN   outdoor pressure
    NN.N   outdoor rainfall total since midnight
    NN     outdoor UV index
  </pre>

  <!--============== Installation ==============-->

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    As a convenience, interface code is included from <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/" target="_blank">JavaHIDAPI</a>
    project.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <var>WxLogger.java</var> code is provided in source form. This has been
    pre-compiled for Java 6 along with the Java HID code into the JAR
    <var>wxlogger.jar</var>. This is supported by the <var>hidapi</var> native
    library. Find the appropriate library file under the <var>res</var>
    directory and install it. On Windows, for example, this requires creating
    <var>hidapi.dll</var> under <var>\Windows\system32</var>. On Linux, for
    example, this requires creating <var>libhidapi.so</var> under
    <var>/usr/lib</var>. Note that <var>WxLogger.java</var> refers to the
    library as <var>hidapi</var> so any suffix like '-jni-32' must be omitted
    in the installation name.
  </p>

  <!--============== Usage ==============-->

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>
    Run <var>WxLogger.java</var> as follows:
  </p>

  <pre>
    java -cp lib/wxlogger.jar uk.ac.stir.cs.wx.WxLogger
  </pre>

  <p>
    The program can be run interactively from a console. It can also be run as a
    background service (Windows) or startup program (Unix).
  </p>

  <p>
    A file for each day is created in the current directory with the name
    'YYYYMMDD.DAT' (e.g. '20130131.DAT'). It contains the following fields
    separated by one or more spaces. Values are calculated for each logging
    interval, except rainfall which is totalled since the previous midnight.
  </p>

  <pre>
    HH:MM:SS               time of log
    NN.N NN.N NN.N         wind speed average/minimum/maximum (m/s)
    NNN NNN NNN            wind direction average/minimum/maximum (deg from N)
    NN.N NN.N NN.N         outdoor temperature average/minimum/maximum (C)
    NN NN NN               outdoor humidity average/minimum/maximum (%)
    NN.N NN.N NN.N         outdoor dewpoint average/minimum/maximum (C)
    NNNN.N NNNN.N NNNN.N   indoor pressure average/minimum/maximum (mb)
    NN.N NN.N NN.N         indoor temperature average/minimum/maximum (C)
    NN NN NN               indoor humidity average/minimum/maximum (%)
    NN                     rainfall total since midnight (mm)
    NN.N NN.N NN.N         wind chill temperature average/minimum/maximum (C)
    NN.N NN.N NN.N         indoor dewpoint average/minimum/maximum (C)
    NN NN NN               UV index average/minimum/maximum (0 low, 6 high, ...)
  </pre>

  <p>
    This format is compatible with that used by the original WeatherView
    software supplied by Oregon Scientific, except that measurements finish with
    an indoor dewpoint and a UV index. Another difference is that rainfall is
    cumulative for each day since midnight. The log format could be customised
    by changing method <var>logMeasures</var>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind chill is normally calculated when an anemometer reading is
    received. If an outdoor temperature has been received and the wind speed is
    high enough, the wind chill is calculated from the North American/UK
    formula. If an outdoor temperature has been received but the wind speed is
    not high enough, the wind chill is set to the outdoor temperature. If an
    outdoor temperature has not been received and the weather station wind chill
    is invalid, the wind chill is set to zero (which may result in the first
    such value being incorrect).

  <p>
    When the program runs interactively, entering '0' to '4' will change the
    logging level from nothing to everything. Entering '.' twice in succession
    will exit the program. Note that a keyboard entry must be followed by Enter
    before it is processed. Keyboard entry is checked only every 10 to 20
    seconds approximately (depending on the length of the main loop).
  </p>

  <p>
    The separate program <var>wxmove</var> (a Perl script) is included to help
    with moving data files from a memory stick or network drive to the hard disc
    of another computer.
